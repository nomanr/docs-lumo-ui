# Kotlin Multiplatform Support

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
  Kotlin Multiplatform support is currently a work in progress. Full support
  across all platforms is coming soon.
</Callout>

## Current Status

While most Lumo UI components are designed with Compose Multiplatform in mind, some platform-specific adjustments are needed for full compatibility. For example, font handling differs between Android and Compose Multiplatform.

<Callout type="info">
  You should be able to use most components with Compose Multiplatform, but you
  may need to make some adjustments manually.
</Callout>

  Follow our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nomanr/lumo-ui) for updates
  on Kotlin Multiplatform support progress.
