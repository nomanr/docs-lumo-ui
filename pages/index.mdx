# Introduction


**Lumo UI** offers a set of beautifully designed UI components, ready to use and customize.

Unlike traditional dependencies or packaged libraries, it’s a Gradle plugin that generates components directly into your codebase. This gives you complete ownership of the code, making it easy to modify and customize to your unique requirements, themes, and design systems.
