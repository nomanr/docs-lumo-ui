# Composables

The composables library provides complex component implementations that are used by some Lumo UI components.

**[https://github.com/nomanr/composables](https://github.com/nomanr/composables)**

<Callout type="warning">
  While I strongly prefer to avoid abstracting components into a separate
  library, the composables library was created as a necessary compromise to
  handle complex component implementations that would otherwise bloat the UI
  components.

<details>
<summary>**Why do I need it?**</summary>

Some UI components like Modal Bottom Sheet and Slider require complex implementations involving animations, state management, and intricate layouts. The composables library was introduced as a last resort to handle these implementations while keeping the end components lightweight.

<details>
<summary>**What if I don't want to use it?**</summary>

If you don't want to use the composables library, you can copy-paste the components from the [GitHub](https://github.com/nomanr/composables) into your app.

</details>

## Installation

Add the composables dependency to your app's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin copy
dependencies {
    implementation("com.nomanr:composables:$version")
}
```

  Check the [latest version](https://github.com/nomanr/composables/releases) on
