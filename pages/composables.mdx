# Composables

<Callout type="warning">
  This does not support `Kotlin Multiplatform` yet.
</Callout>

The composables library provides complex component implementations that are used by some Lumo UI components.

**[https://github.com/nomanr/composables](https://github.com/nomanr/composables)**

<Callout type="warning">
  While I strongly prefer to avoid abstracting components into a separate
  library, the composables library was created as a necessary compromise to
  handle complex component implementations that would otherwise bloat the UI
  components.
</Callout>

<details>
<summary>**Why do I need it?**</summary>

Some UI components like Modal Bottom Sheet and Slider require complex implementations involving animations, state management, and intricate layouts. The composables library was introduced as a last resort to handle these implementations while keeping the end components lightweight.

<details>
<summary>**What if I don't want to use it?**</summary>

If you don't want to use the composables library, you can copy-paste the components from the [GitHub](https://github.com/nomanr/composables) into your app.
